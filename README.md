# bandbind ðŸ¤˜

Many people, and in this case, artists over the world are facing a big problem: COVID-19. Tours and shows totally cancelled and this means almost no contact with their beloved fan-base. It's pretty sad since artists still love doing music and they want to share it with the world! Is there any way to overcome this?
Here's where Bandbind shows up: A subscription based service where you can support and "attend" all your favorite artists shows via livestream! It's like twitch.tv for metalheads lml
Made by fans for fans.
